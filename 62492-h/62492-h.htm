<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> little book, like my book
on Christian Science which
appeared a year ago, is the evolution
of a pamphlet.</p>

<p>The first half of the pamphlet
was written in the middle of a
sleepless night some years ago.
The last half was written about
two years ago, after I had found
relief by auto-suggestion from the
lifelong bondage of insomnia and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
had thereby doubled my capacity
both for work and play.</p>

<p>First published in the spring of
1907 as my weekly message under
the heading of “The Parson’s
Outlook” to the 5000 readers of
<i>The Hampshire Gazette</i> in and
about Northampton, the article
on sleeplessness was republished
by request in the same paper some
months later; then, as the demand
increased for it, in pamphlet form.
This year past it has been used
in the Emmanuel Clinic, both in
Boston and Northampton, with
such gratifying results that more
than 300 sufferers from insomnia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
in one part of the country or
another have testified by letter
or by word of mouth to the
benefit they have received from
it.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the Rev.
Elwood Worcester, Ph.D., D.D.,
two magazine editors, and two
publishing houses, the pamphlet
is now enlarged into a book with
the earnest hope that the suggestions
it contains may be of
service to many whom the pamphlet,
privately printed and gratuitously
distributed, could not
reach at all.</p>

<p>There are books enough, per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>haps,
on the theory of sleep. The
volume by Marie de Manaceïne
on <i>Sleep—Its Physiology, Pathology,
Hygiene, and Psychology</i>
will surely long remain the standard
work. Dr. Upson’s <i>Insomnia
and Nerve Strain</i> is based on the
author’s discovery of the vaso-neural
circuit and will not be
neglected by those who wish to
understand certain physical obstacles
to sleep which have hitherto
been largely overlooked. <i>Religion
and Medicine</i>, the official
book of the Emmanuel Movement,
is indispensable to any knowledge
of the drugless cure of sleeplessness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
and other nervous functional disorders.
And the writings of Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell, Dr. Woods
Hutchinson, and Dr. J. Madison
Taylor are, of course, of lasting
value on this subject.</p>

<p>The purpose of this little book
is very simple. It is designed to
help physicians, Emmanuel workers,
and others who believe in the
art of natural sleep to aid those
committed to their care. It is
designed, also, to be of service
to the thousands who never go
to anyone for aid in learning
how to sleep, and to this end is
kept as free as possible from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
technical terms and all theoretical
discussions.</p>

<p>To Dr. Worcester I owe the
title of the book; to Rev. H. L.
Taylor of the Emmanuel Church
staff certain of the illustrative
cases from the Emmanuel Clinic
in Boston; to Mr. W. P. Cutter,
Librarian of the Forbes Library
in Northampton, many special
courtesies; and to Dr. Francis S.
Wilson, expert diagnostician and
experienced practitioner, goodly
counsel in the preparation of the
book.</p>

<p>Trusting that directly or indirectly
this little book may set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
many an unhappy victim of insomnia
free from his hard bondage,
I send it forth in faith.</p>

Natural Sleep</p>



<hr class="small" />
<h2 id="OUR_NATIONAL_DISEASE">OUR NATIONAL DISEASE</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Neurasthenia</span> is now our
national disease. Nervousness,
nervous exhaustion, nervous
prostration, and kindred names are
given to it by the doctors. Whatever
they may chance to call it,
the doctors usually agree as to its
causes, symptoms, consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>Even the laity are now thoroughly
informed as to the effect
of neurasthenia on the nerves and
on the mind. It wears the nerves
threadbare and robs the mind
of all serenity. It steals the zest
from work, the joy from play. It
frequently reduces its unhappy
victim to the single occupation of
worrying by day because he fears
he will not sleep at night, of worrying
at night because he knows that
worn and haggard he will have
no buoyancy and poise to play
a man’s part in the day to come.</p>

<p>The day’s work is done, when
done at all, with the feverish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
inquietude of the unrested brain.
The evening’s pleasures, when
infrequently he ventures to take
part in them, are clouded by the
listlessness the lack of sleep invariably
brings. The silent night,
when by any reach of the imagination
it can be thus described,</p>

<p>
Of fret, of dark, of thorn, of chill,<br />
</p>

<p>is rendered hideous by the flitting
of attention like a bird from bough
to bough, by the random running
of the memory down each unhappy
recollection of the past, by the
deflection of the mental vision
till it loses all perspective and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
disqualifies the sufferer to think
straight concerning even the trivial
occurrences of everyday existence.</p>

<p>No wonder that in Kipling’s
story <i>At the End of the Passage</i>,
when Spurstow finds his sleepless
friend in the last stage of insomnia,
he sadly but severely says, “Sleeplessness
of your kind being very
apt to relax the moral fibre in
little matters of life and death,
I’ll just take the liberty of spiking
your guns;” and then as a safeguard,
robs Hummil of his rifle and
revolver.</p>

<h2 id="THEORIES_OF_SLEEP">THEORIES OF SLEEP</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Various</span> theories have at one
time or another been suggested
to account for sleep. Some
are both bewildering and absurd.
There was a time when it was
seriously urged that sleep has in
the thyroid gland its special organ,
but when someone in the interest
of the theory excised the thyroid
gland, only to increase in certain
instances the tendency to go to
sleep and stay asleep, the theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
was at once abandoned even by
its staunchest advocates.</p>

<p>Finding that sleep usually follows
fatigue, and that fatigue is
a chemical phenomenon, the so-called
chemical theory was next set
up, and Sommer was quite sure
that sleep comes as a consequence
of the exhaustion of the reserve
of oxygen in the tissues and
the blood, and its replacement
by carbonic acid during sleep.
But here, too, experimentation
has been both inadequate and
inconclusive.</p>

<p>The vaso-motor theory, as modified
by Howell, that sleep is due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
to the anæmia of the cortical layer
of the brain, which invariably takes
place when the blood pressure in
the arteries at the base of the
brain falls, has had a larger and a
longer following. But convincing
proof is yet to be secured, and Dr.
Percy G. Stiles of the Bellevue
Hospital ends his discussion of the
subject with a guarded inference
that there may be truth in both
the theories, and that eclecticism
is in consequence the wisest policy
for the histologist.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>
<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>



<h2 id="WHAT_SLEEP_REALLY_IS">WHAT SLEEP REALLY IS</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sleep</span>, however we account for
it, is “the resting time of
consciousness.”<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> To be sure, there
is no absolute arrest of brain activity.
There is always, even in
the soundest sleep, some cerebral
activity.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> We dream. We have
nightmares. We sometimes work
out problems in our sleep which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
have defied our every waking
effort. There is on record one
instance of a college student who
got up at three o’clock to solve
successfully, while sound asleep, a
problem he could not work out at
all before he went to bed. There
is another instance well attested
of a British consul in Syria who,
after tearing up letter after letter
which he wrote to a Lebanon emir,
went to sleep in sheer despair, only
to find when he awoke in the
morning, that he had written an
elaborate letter which in every
way satisfied the multitudinous
demands of Arabic diplomacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
insistent to the last on all the
niceties of Oriental etiquette.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Byron was right. Sleep is neither
life nor death. It is a world
apart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent4">Sleep has its own world,</div>
  <div class="verse">A boundary between the things misnamed</div>
  <div class="verse">Death and Existence; sleep has its own world.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pnind">Consciousness may be suspended.
But the cortical centres are frequently
as active when we are
asleep as when awake. The attention
can be maintained with
such unbroken steadiness as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
awake some persons with the exactness
of an alarm clock on the
very minute, even though for purposes
of deception the hands of the
clock may have been set back without
their knowledge. The motor
centres can be counted on so confidently
that they will drive the
somnambulist with the accuracy
of a trained chauffeur to his
appointed destination. Sleep is,
therefore, nothing more than a
temporary suspension of a portion
of the brain’s activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>


<h2 id="THE_NECESSITY_OF_SLEEP">THE NECESSITY OF SLEEP</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">But</span> that suspension is an absolute
necessity to health of
mind and body. Men have been
known to go for forty days without
nourishment and retain unimpaired
all the mental faculties.
No man goes for even three days
and nights without sleep except
he pay a penalty in mental equipoise,
and death itself is apt to
bring his misery to an end, it is
claimed, in five sleepless nights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and days. Professors Patrick and
Gilbert of the University of Iowa
found, some years ago, that in
certain cases there were after two
nights of complete wakefulness
hallucinations, loss of attention,
inability to remember, and unmistakable
evidences both of mental
disorganisation and physical depression.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
In Kipling’s story, tragically
true to life, Hummil died
after eighty-four hours of unrelieved
insomnia, and the author’s
closing words would seem to indicate
that madness overtook him
at the last:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> “In the staring eyes
was written terror beyond expression
of any pain.”</p>

<p>The occasional genius like Napoleon
may perhaps get on habitually
with four hours of sleep
each night, and the mother watching
by the sick-bed of her child
may go for weeks in an emergency
with but an hour or two of sleep
at intervals, infrequent and irregular.
But the sensible division
made by Alfred the Great into
eight hours for sleep, eight hours
for work, eight hours for play, will
be as far as possible observed by
the right-minded and far-seeing
everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="INSOMNIA_AND_ITS_CAUSES">INSOMNIA AND ITS CAUSES</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Insomnia</span> reduced to simplest
terms is nothing but the inability
to sleep. While the causes
of insomnia may sometimes be exceedingly
complex, ordinarily they
are evident both to us and those
we love the best. Anything, as
we all learn by experience, which
accelerates the activity of the
mind and increases the congestion
of the brain is likely to induce
insomnia. Worry, fear, grief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
prolonged mental effort, any sort
of emotional excitement, social
dissipation, the intemperate use of
coffee, tea, or alcohol are among
the most familiar causes of insomnia.
Disturbances of digestion, neuralgic
pains, arterial disease, eye-strain,
and dental lesions are the
hidden causes, oftener than we imagine,
of protracted wakefulness.</p>

<p>Many of the more obstinate
cases of insomnia are due, we
know at last through Dr. Upson’s
remarkable book,<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> to some dental
lesion unsuspected because, as is
not uncommon, it is unaccompa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>nied
by the ache habitually associated
with all the ills to which
the teeth are heirs. In my Emmanuel
clinic I have had one case
of insomnia which, in spite of all
an efficient doctor could do for
the body and the Emmanuel
worker for the mind, persisted
until I at last discovered that the
sufferer was in immediate need
of a dentist, whose threshold,
through a morbid fear, he had
not crossed in many years.</p>

<h2 id="THE_VALUE_OF_DRUGS">THE VALUE OF DRUGS</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> insomnia there is no specific
known to medicine.
While the good family doctor may
correct digestive disturbances, banish
for the time neuralgic pains,
modify arterial disease, relieve with
the oculist’s assistance eye-strain,
and through the dentist remove the
cause of dental lesions, sometimes
insomnia persists long after the
physical cause has disappeared.
I have had in my clinic one case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
of chronic sleeplessness caused
by a headache which appeared
incurable though the cause of the
headache and insomnia alike had
vanished years before.</p>

<p>Drugs which induce sleep induce
it merely for the time. Doctor
Caillé in his large experience has
found morphia invaluable for the
inhibiting of pain or of severe
dyspnœa, chloral and the bromides
useful in cases of visceral neuralgia,
codein and urethan in arteriosclerosis,
and in pulmonary tuberculosis,
where beer and porter failed
to bring the longed-for sleep,
dionin, trional, and hyoscin. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
in ordinary cases of insomnia,
where the cause is evidently more
psychical than physical, he is inclined
to turn rather to suggestion
in one form or another.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Drugs are sure to make a difference
in the morning. The dulness
and depression which they leave
behind, in spite of all the claims
of those who put on the market
their proprietary hypnotics, offset
to some extent the artificial sleep
they have the night before produced.
Sometimes they fill the
mind for days with morbid fancies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and with dangerous obsessions.
Dr. J. Madison Taylor describes in
some detail the case of a lunatic
under his care who developed
homicidal tendencies as a consequence
of the administration of
large doses of bromide, and who
lost the same the moment the bromide
was withdrawn from him.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
On credible authority I am informed
that there is among the
alienists a growing disposition, on
this account, to give no drugs at
all to induce sleep in patients in
the higher class of hospitals for
the insane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>Morphia is not only no specific;
it sometimes causes both a mental
and a physical depression worse
than the insomnia it would relieve.
In my clinic I have one woman
from whom morphia, administered
to relieve acute pain, took away
the power to sleep at all, and for
years she stoically bore her pain
rather than resort to morphia,
until last winter she found in the
Emmanuel treatment immediate
and unfailing relief from pain,
followed by sound sleep, which
has only at rare intervals been
interrupted in months past.</p>

<p>Powerful as chloral is and useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
in the thoughtful doctor’s hands in
various emergencies, especially in
fevers where there is cerebral excitement,
it is a depressant, and
he who contracts the chloral habit
invariably wishes at the last that
he had waited for damnation till
after he was dead. Sulphonal,
trional, veronal, paraldehyde, and
those proprietary hypnotics whose
composition is withheld from the
public appear to be least harmful
of all sleeping drugs. But they
all inebriate or stupefy the fragile
cells of the brain, none too
solid in the best of us; and in
the psychically weak or emotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>ally
excitable they may even put
the delicately constructed thinking
organ altogether out of commission.</p>

CAUSES</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Though</span> there may be no specific
for insomnia in the drug
store, the complaint can often be
relieved when the cause is wholly
physical by striking at its root. If
the general practitioner fails to
relieve disturbances of the digestion,
the stomach specialist should
be consulted. One of my patients,
who had for two years
suffered both from insomnia and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
other troubles which had exhausted
the ingenuity and the resources of
the local doctors he consulted,
began to improve as soon as a
stomach specialist of national repute
to whom I sent him discovered
by chemical analysis of
the contents of his stomach an
incredibly excessive acidity, for
which the proper prescription
and diet were at once suggested.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>
<p>In cases where insomnia is evidently
due to some physical ailment
which cannot be at once
located, a visit to the oculist, the
dentist, and even the throat and
nose specialist should as a matter
of course be paid even if the
patient has no conscious need of
them. In at least two instances
which have come under my observation,
the insomnia disappeared
after proper treatment of
the eyes and teeth and throat,
though two general practitioners
had suspected nothing wrong in
one case with the eyes, and in
the other a visit to the throat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
specialist was never once suggested
by the doctor who sent the
case to me for the Emmanuel
treatment.</p>

<h2 id="GENERAL_DIRECTIONS">GENERAL DIRECTIONS</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> many cases no local ailment
would appear to be responsible
for the insomnia, and yet in every
instance attention must be given
to the body’s entire needs. The
habit of deep breathing from the
diaphragm must be developed
and be regularly practised both
indoors and out. This alone sufficed
in one complicated case to
bring sleep every night. The diet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
must be carefully chosen and followed
in the face of every importunity
of a silly and capricious
appetite. Tea and coffee, save at
the morning meal, must be in almost
every case eliminated from
the menu. Constipation, which
is responsible far oftener than we
think for sleeplessness, must be,
whenever possible, at once corrected
without resort to purgatives
and enemas.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The hot bath sometimes
brings sleep by relieving the
congestion of the brain, but contraction
of the blood-vessels often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
follows with such promptness
that the hot-water bottle applied
to the feet or the back of the
neck or both is likely to be of
more service.</p>

<p>If running up and down stairs
or exercise in that wood-pile now
imaginary in the average home
leaves the sufferer as wide awake
as ever, Doctor J. B. Learned’s
provision for taking exercise in
bed without displacement of the
covering will sometimes relieve
both the cerebral congestion and
the psychical exhilaration and let
the wakeful one drop off to sleep
at the drowsy moment, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
apt to pass if the exercise is taken
out of bed and even scanty preparations
have in consequence to be
made for retiring.</p>

without some seeming hurt to the

insomnia the most that can apparently
be done is to stand cheerfully
and confidently between him and
the temptation to grow morbid
and melancholy, to keep the house
as quiet as circumstances will allow,
to provide for the bedtime hour a
glass of hot milk with its pinch of
salt in it, the hot malted milk unsweetened,
the clam bouillon, the
beef extract, or a cup of cocoa
which every insomniast should
take before he goes to bed, and
by day and night to soothe, sustain,
and cheer the troubled spirit.</p>

<h2 id="DR_LEARNEDS_PLAN">DR. LEARNED’S PLAN</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> physiological problem is
uncomplicated. As Dr.
Learned, who more than a quarter
of a century ago cured himself of
habitual insomnia by getting control
of the respiratory and circulatory
functions in the sleeping
posture, has made clear, the problem
is simply to shift the belt of
attention from the wildly whirling
wheel of introspection to the
steadier wheel the will revolves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>By deep regular respirations,
accompanied by rhythmical movements
of the head and hands and
feet, Dr. Learned has frequently
brought the wandering attention
back from some side track it
sought in fitfulness to the main
line of the controlled consciousness.
So surely has he in recent years become
convinced that the problem
is usually psychical that he no
longer emphasises physical exercises
in or out of bed. Instead
he provides an ingenious little
tablet on which the wakeful one
with unlifted pencil steadily records
in waving lines his inhala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>tions
and his exhalations until at
last, fatigued by the long exercise,
the brain becomes anæmic and
sleep overtakes the drowsy mind.</p>

BREATHING</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To</span> Mrs. Annie Payson Call<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and
Dr. Emily Noble we owe of
late the stress we lay on muscular
relaxation and rhythmic breathing,
which practised faithfully will
now and then bring sleep where
drugs are worse than useless.
Muscular relaxation can be learned
by any who will take the trouble.
The Delsarteans are already adepts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
at it. The letting of the arms
drop limp by the side as one sits
in an easy chair, the letting of the
trunk sink unsupported against
the easy chair as though it were
sinking into a yielding bank of
snow, the letting of the head fall
forward or sideways without resistance
will furnish even to the
slow of wits a visual image which
will serve as a sufficient pattern in
the relaxation of the whole body.</p>

<p>Dr. Emily Noble, who has seen
Oriental soldiers at the end of a
long march throw themselves in
complete relaxation on their backs,
gives in her <i>Rhythmic Breathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
plus Olfactory Nerve Influence
on Respiration</i> possibly the most
practical of all directions for the
mature in the important art of
relaxation. She bids him lie upon
his back on a hard surface, with
head turned to one side in order
to relieve the tension on the
muscles of the neck, with arms
extended at right angles, with the
palms turned up, with feet turned
out and spread for comfort at least
a foot apart.</p>

<p>The lungs are then to be cleared
of their static air by a few deep
inhalations, made through the left
nostril because in the average man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
it seems to furnish a freer channel
for the air than the right nostril.
Next the insomniast settles down
to lighter rhythmic breathing,
which is nothing but the consequence
of the conscious effort to
make each exhalation equal to
each inhalation. He should take
the “breath in as gently as the
fog creeps in from the sea.” He
should let it out “as the air goes
out of little children’s balloons
when it is allowed to escape.”</p>

<p>As with experience all feeling of
conscious effort passes, he will have
a sense of letting go, the muscles
will of their own accord relax, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
quiet mind will come, especially if
a pleasant thought be held steadily
before it, the insomniast will
stretch and yawn, take instinctively
if he be in bed the sleep
position, and pass off into a dreamless
sleep which will indeed knit
up “the ravell’d sleave of care,”
and make him ready for a day of
effective thinking and efficient
action.</p>

<h2 id="THE_EMMANUEL_METHOD">THE EMMANUEL METHOD</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> sleeplessness can be
directly traced to mental
causes, the Emmanuel treatment,
if experiments made both in Boston
and Northampton are to be
trusted, is as surely a specific as
quinine for malaria. If in any instance
medical diagnosis can find
no physical reason for the sleeplessness,
Emmanuel treatment is
at once in order.</p>

<p>The sufferer is admitted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Rector’s study. The very atmosphere
encourages frank speaking.
Concealment of any fact or circumstance
which bears upon the case
is prejudicial to improvement. I
have once after three treatments
refused again to see a patient who
had failed to give me her whole
confidence, until she was willing
to speak out with greater freedom.
The physical habits are invariably
considered and corrected whenever
there is need. Deep breathing is
prescribed. Dr. Learned’s method
is sometimes suggested, and always
Dr. Noble’s. Drugs are from the
first withheld. Tea, coffee, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
all other stimulants which act
directly on the brain are banished
from the evening meal. The sufferer
is encouraged as the bedtime
hour draws near to give himself
to such interests as scatter the
cares and worries and obsessions
which are then wont to gather like
a cloud around the patient’s head.</p>

<p>For some a social evening is
suggested, provided it be not too
exciting. For others the theatre,
the symphony, or other form
of public entertainment serves
the same purpose. For perhaps
a larger number, especially the
preacher, or the teacher, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
literary worker, a magazine, a
novel with no miserable modern
problem in it, or a standard history
will in a half-hour let down the
mind to the sleep level. I know
one man who found Parkman’s
histories a soporific boon; another
whom Green’s longer <i>History of
the English People</i> led on each
night to wholesome sleep; another,
the head of a large sanitarium, who
sometimes saves himself from
sleeplessness by reading after he
has gone to bed as dull a book
as he can find, and recommends
the same plan with some profit
to his patients.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> main reliance, however,
in the Emmanuel treatment
is on faith, reinforced first by
hetero-suggestion and then by
patient and persistent auto-suggestion.
The man who would be
permanently free from insomnia
must be an optimist. He must
have a philosophy of life wholesome
enough to keep him buoyant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
cheerful, and serene amid all the
changes and the chances of this
mortal life. With the Persian he
may hold that “He’s a Good
Fellow, and ’twill all be well;”
with Socrates that “To the good
man no evil thing can happen;”
or with St. Paul that “All things
work together for good to them
that love the Lord.”</p>

<p>Whatever language he may
use in the formulation of his life
philosophy, he must believe with
all his heart and soul that life in
spite of all appearances is worth
living, that there is love and
goodness at the heart of things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
that the word God, whatever be
its content, does stand for a
concept indispensable in our
everyday existence, and that there
is somewhere, everywhere, One
who, by a paradox as strange as
it is true, is both the centre and
circumference of all that has been,
is, and ever is to be—The Absolute
and Unconditioned wherever
we may chance to be in time or
space.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> “If I climb up into heaven,
Thou art there: if I go down
to hell, Thou art there also. If I
take the wings of the morning:
and remain in the uttermost parts
of the sea; even there also shall
Thy hand lead me: and Thy right
hand shall hold me.”<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>A man who wants that serenity
of mind on which the soundest
sleep invariably depends must
get right and keep right with
God, whether he defines Him in
the terms of Persia, Greece, or
Christianity.</p>

<p>But this is not enough. A
man must be right also with his
fellow-men. He must love his
neighbour as he loves his God.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
“He that loveth not his brother
whom he hath seen, how can
he love God whom he hath not
seen?” He must have more than
a languid interest in his brother.
He must wish him better than
well. He must have done forever
with sharp practice, hard bargaining,
ungracious criticism, and
that subtle disloyalty which often
through sheer cowardice stands
mute while slander wags its tongue
or envy shoots its Parthian arrows
back as it retreats.</p>

<p>With the spirit’s eye he must
see even in the poorest and the
meanest of his fellows some charm
which others have not found.
He must with the Christ insight
pierce to the heart of the roughest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
boulder that was ever hewn from
the hard mountain-side of seamy
human nature and let loose the
imbedded angel always there and
always struggling to be free. No
man has any right to sleep, in
fact to any of God’s better gifts,
who goes through life with slanting
eye and lowering brow sullenly
protesting to himself:</p>

to pay this double price of
love to God and love to man for
the peace that passeth understanding
and that also bringeth
sleep, he is ready for Emmanuel
treatment. Seated in the Morris
chair before the smouldering fire
with curtains drawn, he is taught
to relax his muscles, the cortical
layer of the brain is quieted by
soothing suggestions, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
standing behind the chair the
Emmanuel worker begins the
treatment somewhat thus in a
low monotone:</p>

<p>You are now relaxed in body
and quieted in mind. You are to
let your thoughts languidly follow
mine expressed in words. Do not
offer any mental opposition. I
shall say nothing which your mind
will not instinctively accept and
cherish.</p>

<p>Fix your thoughts on God.
Think of Him not alone as the
All-Father but also as the Universal
Mind in which your mind exists
exactly as each individual thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
floats in your mind. Think of
Him not merely as your Heavenly
Father but also as the Universal
Spirit on which your soul depends
for every breath of spiritual life,
just as your body is dependent for
its every breath of physical existence
on the air you breathe.
Believe that in this larger, higher,
truer sense, “In Him we live and
move and have our being.”</p>

<p>Now Universal Mind or Universal
Spirit is wholesomeness and
love, harmony and power. Realise
that when your soul breathes in
the atmosphere in which it lives
it breathes in wholesomeness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
love, harmony and power. But
it is possible, in the exercise of the
free will with which you are in the
nature of the case endowed, to fill
up the soul with morbidness and
selfishness, disunity and weakness,
so that there is no room in it for
God’s wholesomeness and love, His
harmony and power.</p>

<p>You do not sleep because you
are “all replete with very <i>Thou</i>.”
You have filled up your soul with
thoughts of self, or thoughts of
others from the point of view of
self. You have worried when you
should have cast your care on
Him; “for He careth for you.”
You have yielded to all sorts of
foolish fears, forgetful that “perfect
love casteth out fear.” You
have been self-centred, though
God Himself was so far centred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
out of self that “He gave His only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting life.”</p>

<p>In the silence of this quiet hour
put your worries and your fears
away and swing your centre out of
self. Open wide the windows of
your soul and let the Spirit in
of wholesomeness and love, of
harmony and power. Believe the
Spirit will come in. Interpret in
the terms of Spirit those veracious
words of Revelation:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> “Behold, I
stand at the door, and knock; if
any man hear my voice, and open
the door, I will come in to him,
and will sup with him, and he
with me.”</p>

<p>Wait for the incoming Spirit.
Wait in faith and confidence. Remember
that “They that wait
upon the Lord shall renew their
strength; they shall mount up
with wings as eagles; they shall
run, and not be weary; they shall
walk, and not faint.”</p>

<p>With your mind filled with the
Spirit of wholesomeness and love,
of harmony and power, it will be
at rest; it will know the peace that
passeth understanding. All nerve-strain
will go. Sleep will come to-night.
Sleep will come to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
night. Sleep will come every
night. Sound sleep, re-creating
sleep so long denied you, will be
yours at last. The day will never
know again its feverish inquietude.
Work will have its zest, and play
its joy. The silent night will lose
its morbid fancies and its horrid
nightmares, and you will each
morning wake with the song upon
your lips:</p>

a few minutes every day to go

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Again</span> and again one treatment
of this sort—faith reinforced
by reiterated suggestion—has
sufficed to break up the
most obstinate insomnia. One
man on the verge of suicide from
hitherto incurable insomnia went
home from this first treatment to
sleep soundly for several nights
thereafter. Another man on
whom a heart-breaking disappointment
had swept down with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>out
a word of warning went home
to sleep eight hours and a half
for the first time in many nights.
A trained nurse so long on night
duty that she had slipped her
sleep cog to the demoralisation
of her entire nervous system slept
normally again after but one visit
to me.</p>

<p>A college instructor sleepless
on the verge of a new year of
academic strain thus secured the
long night’s sleep she coveted
the day before the opening of
college. A wife and mother overwhelmed
by a domestic tragedy
after six weeks of drugged sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
went home from her first treatment
with a shining face to sleep
ever after without taking any
drugs. A college girl worn sleepless
by the heat and burden of
earning her own living while she
kept up her standing in the college,
reported marked improvement
after her first treatment. And a
neurasthenic who had lost all hope
of ever sleeping better slept so
much better after a single treatment
that she insists in spite of all
my protests in placing her experience
among the modern miracles.</p>

necessary than one treatment.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
Sometimes a dozen treatments
are required. And at every stage
the patient’s close co-operation is
of utmost consequence. In fact,
the cure can never be effected
without it. To faith reinforced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
by the Emmanuel worker’s suggestions
must be added the auto-suggestions
of the patient. He
must will to keep the loving attitude
toward God and man. He
must cease to worry about sleep.
He must never mention his symptoms
to anyone except the Emmanuel
worker who is treating
him.</p>

<p>He must cultivate a heavenly
unconcern about himself. He
must keep saying to himself the
whole day through: It does not
matter anyway. If I sleep, well
and good. If I do not sleep I
will not worry over it. To lie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
awake at night is not so terrible
as I once thought. Bed is for
rest as well as sleep. The worry
over lack of sleep hurts more than
sleeplessness itself. Rest is possible
even when I can not sleep.
Happy thoughts will rob the darkness
of its gloom and minimise
nerve-strain.</p>

<p>If I keep still in my normal sleep
position eight hours every night
in bed, if I relax every muscle and
let it stay relaxed; if I breathe
lightly, regularly, rhythmically in
a well-ventilated room, making
sure the early morning light will
not strike across my face and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
wake me up; if I simulate sleep
in every way I can; if I shut out
all preoccupation, expect each
night to go to sleep, and steadily
hour after hour suggest sleep to
myself in words like these I shall
surely go to sleep:</p>

<p>I am going to sleep. I shall not
lie awake. I cannot lie awake.
I am going to sleep. The tired
eyes are closing. The blood is
flowing from my brain to my extremities.
There is no longer any
pressure on the brain. The muscles
are relaxing. Sleep is stealing
over all my senses. They
are growing numb. I am getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
drowsy, drowsy. I am softly sinking
into sleep, dreamless sleep. I
am sinking deeper, deeper, deeper.
I am almost asleep. I am asleep,

<hr class="small" />

<h3>I. CURED BY SUGGESTION ALONE</h3>


<h4>A.—Waking Suggestion</h4>

<p>1. The Emmanuel Clinic in
Boston reports the case of a distinguished
lawyer who after nine
months of insomnia came to Emmanuel
Church for counsel. He
was on the verge of a nervous
breakdown. His habit was to
take his work and worries every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
night to bed with him. He was
advised to submit to the rest
cure under a good neurologist.
He replied that, with important
cases coming up at once for trial,
rest was impossible. In fact, he
could at most spend a few hours
in Boston. The causes of insomnia
were then explained to
him. Suggestions were given
looking toward self-help. The importance
of cheerful and uplifting
thoughts was emphasised. He
went away an hour later to report
in a few weeks that he was entirely
cured and had not felt so
well since he was a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>2. Dubois (p. 340) speaks of
a physician twenty-three years
of age who had suffered for nine
months from persistent insomnia.
By bromides, bathing, travel, and
the cessation of all work, he had
obtained only transient results.
Dubois drew his attention to the
psychic causes of insomnia, counselled
the immediate abandonment
both of the treatment he
had been giving himself and of all
apprehension of insomnia. In a
few days sleep returned, the convalescent
resumed his customary
duties, and was soon completely
well again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>


<h4>B.—Profound Suggestion</h4>

<p>Forel (p. 252) describes the case
of a working-girl who suffered for a
year and a half from extreme sleeplessness.
All means for her relief
failed. Forel induced profound
suggestion, let her sleep about an
hour every day while she was still
in his clinic room, and after three
weeks discharged her completely
cured and able regularly to sleep
nine hours out of every twenty-four.</p>


<h3>2. CURED BY FAITH REINFORCED
BY SUGGESTION</h3>


<h4>A.—Inability to go to sleep on going
to bed</h4>

<p>A clergyman forty years of age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
had inherited a tendency to sleeplessness.
Even as a child it was
not uncommon for him to lie
awake an hour or two after getting
into bed. As he passed into
his teens the presence of his
brother or a boy friend in the
same bed would invariably keep
him wide awake the whole night
through. At college the unusual
strain of extra work or of examinations
was likely to drive sleep
entirely away, and only with the
help of bromides at special seasons
was he able to get through his
studies and take his place at
last among the honour men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>His first years out of college
were spent in graduate study and
educational work, and were made
miserable by the gradual increase
of insomnia, which shut him out
of many social pleasures and impaired
his efficiency.</p>

<p>His first ten years in the ministry
were checkered by so many
stubborn attacks of insomnia that
he was more than once on the
verge of a complete breakdown,
from which the drugs the doctors
gave him furnished only temporary
relief.</p>

<p>Two years ago, after six weeks
of sleeplessness during which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
had at his doctor’s orders taken
a hypnotic every night, he was
able to sleep at most three hours
out of every twenty-four and was
haunted by obsessions and pervasive
fears. When even morphia
failed to induce anything more
than extreme drowsiness and the
heart’s action was so weak that
strychnine was prescribed to make
it function properly, one sleepless
night a physician peremptorily
bade him keep in the sleep position
and never move, breathe regularly,
keep his eyes closed as in
sleep, and in every way imaginable
to simulate sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>This proved to be the turning
point in his experience. Sleep
came night after night in consequence
of his unvarying obedience
to the doctor’s orders. From
one source or another he discovered
how to relax and to
suggest sleep to himself. Within
a month he had learned to sleep
at will, and only once in two
years, when for some weeks there
was continuous local pain, has
his sleep been interrupted. The
average both of physical and of
mental health has been at least
doubled, and these two years past
he has done, without fatigue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
mind or body, at least twice as
much work as in any two years
of his life before.</p>


<h4>B.—Waking in the middle of the
night</h4>

<p>A widow, seventy-three years
of age, suffering for twelve years
from neurasthenia, was apt to
wake about the middle of every
night and to go to sleep no more.
The loss of sleep was bad enough,
but the morbid fancies which
invariably came in swarms sometimes
all but drove her to distraction.
There was such a bad
family history as to sleep and
such poor circulation with its in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>evitable
cold feet, that the physician
gave me little hope of relieving
her insomnia. During the
first month of her treatment I,
therefore, confined myself almost
entirely to the upbuilding of her
faith by a course of optimistic
reading and by suggestion. I
seldom spoke about her sleeplessness
at all. To her surprise
and mine in a few weeks her
sleep began to improve. At the
end of two months, though she
still awoke two or three nights
every week, no morbid fancies
came. She filled up her mind
with wholesome thoughts, re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>peated
again and again the auto-suggestions
on page 68, and
usually awoke almost as much
refreshed as though she had slept
the whole night through. Now
after almost a year she reports
what used to be one bad night
out of every four or five, but
as compared with the bad nights—four
or five a week—of former
years it were better called, she
thinks, a good night than a bad
one.</p>


<h4>C.—Waking early in the morning</h4>

<p>1. A college girl of unusual
ability and character had prac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>tically
all her life been inclined
to wake at two or three o’clock
in the morning and often go to
sleep no more; or if she went
to sleep, to sleep badly and be
subject to hideous dreams and
horrible nightmares. After one
treatment, June 15th, she began
at once to sleep much better.
Though she sometimes woke as
formerly at two or three, she
at once by relaxation and auto-suggestion
usually went off to sleep
again and suffered little from
dreams and nightmares. She has
had two treatments since, and is
not only much improved in body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
but is happier and more serene
in mind.</p>

<p>2. The Emmanuel Clinic in
Boston reports the case of an unmarried
woman, fifty-two years
old, who usually slept four hours a
night, awaking at 2.30 and never
sleeping more. Her treatment
was begun June 20, 1907, and
was followed by immediate improvement.
By July 1, 1907,
she was sleeping without waking
eight hours every night, and reported
August, 1908, that the
improvement had become permanent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>


<h4>D.—Semi-sleep</h4>

<p>1. A college girl had never
had the feeling of being sound
asleep. She thought she was
half conscious the night through.
What sleep she got never seemed
to refresh her. She came
to me for treatment, February
7, 1908, slept somewhat better
for a night or two, and came
back, February 14th, 18th, 25th,
for other treatments. On March
13th she reported that though
she was not completely cured
she was sleeping more soundly
and felt better in every way.
There was in this case the un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>happy
complication of organic
heart trouble.</p>

<p>2. To the Emmanuel Clinic
in Boston came, January 2, 1908,
a clergyman forty-nine years old
who reported that for years he
had never slept, but merely dozed.
He gave up preaching in 1903;
then resumed it only to abandon
it again in April, 1907. After
treatment from January 2nd to
March 9th he was discharged,
much improved, and on May 4th
he reported that he was still improving,
and is now sleeping well
from six and a half to seven hours
every night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>


<h4>E.—Insomnia from psychical shock</h4>

<p>A woman thirty-four years old
was plunged into insomnia six
years ago by the psychical shock
which followed a violent attack
made on her by an insane woman.
Her habit afterwards was to lie
awake for three or four hours after
retiring, and then to sleep about
two hours every night. Whenever
she lay down to sleep, whether her
eyes were open or closed, she felt
herself surrounded by people, some
of whom had been dead for several
years, and one of whom she fancied
wished to kill her. To the hallucinations
dizziness was often added.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Bromides which she had long
been taking began at last to lose
their effect. Treatment of her
was begun at the Emmanuel Clinic
in Boston on February 25, 1908.
By March 10th she was sleeping
better, though not soundly, and
for thirteen nights the hallucinations
had been absent. April 8th
she reported that the visions
still came now and then but
were fewer and less terrifying.
By May 21st the dizziness had
disappeared, the hallucinations
had not come for several weeks,
her mind was clear, her sleep
was much improved, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
was sure that she was getting
well.</p>


<h4>F.—Insomnia from family trouble</h4>

<p>A mother forty-one years of age
had suffered several family bereavements.
Her children had
been sick more than is common.
Her brother had been burned to
death. She herself had undergone
a surgical operation. For seven
years she had suffered from insomnia,
never even temporarily
relieved except by taking sulphonal,
trional, etc. It seemed to
be the fear of sleeplessness that
usually kept her from her sleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Under treatment at the Emmanuel
Clinic in Boston from
September 21, 1907, to January
27, 1908, she steadily improved,
and is now in every way much
better.</p>

<p>"An interesting theory in explanation of many cases of insomnia
and insanity is brought forth and illustrated by Dr. Henry S. Upson
of Cleveland, in his book on ‘Insomnia and Nerve Strain.’ Dr.
Upson believes that very many cases of mania, melancholia, and dementia
are caused by defective teeth.</p>

<p>“The work is technical, and for the profession rather than the
lay reader. It will doubtless prove of great value as a contribution
to the warfare being waged against the mental scourges that fill our
asylums with young people on the threshold of productive activity.”—<i>Cleveland
Plain Dealer.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Upson is, we believe, the first medical practitioner to write
extensively on this topic and the first to accompany his writing with
skiagraphs relating to his cases. His enthusiasm in this matter may
be the means of arousing a greater interest in it than hitherto has
been manifested by physicians.”—<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>“The author has presented his conceptions in a most attractive
and entertaining manner and time alone will say whether his deductions
will rest on true scientific ground. The treatment of insomnia
if carried out along the lines suggested will not only benefit a great
number of distressing conditions but will undoubtedly curtail the indiscriminate
use of hypnotics at present prevailing.</p>

<p>“The closing chapter by Lodge on the technic of dental skiagraphy
will prove valuable to many engaged in this branch of practice.
The excellence of the reproductions is a pleasing feature of the work.”—<i>Cleveland

As the proof comes, the patient in question
writes me that his insomnia was of the
fitful type. He had so much trouble in going
to sleep promptly that he formed the habit
of sitting up late and inducing the sleep mood
by reading. Since his treatment ended, he
writes me (Sept. 12th), “This summer I have
retired at nine o’clock with few exceptions,
gone to sleep immediately, and risen at half
past six in the morning thoroughly refreshed.”</p></div>
